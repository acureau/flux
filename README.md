# About Flux

Flux is a personal blog engine (currently a markdown SSG). It does what I want from it at this moment, and is bound to change with my requirements. Or, you know, be abandoned... hence it is _in flux_.

## Current Features

- Write posts in markdown.
- Index and post pages.
- Simple HTML templating system.
  - Site-wide and post-specific constants.
  - File inclusion.
- Development server.
