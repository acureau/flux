# About Flux

Flux is a personal blog engine (currently a markdown SSG). It does what I want from it at this moment, and is bound to change with my requirements. Or, you know, be abandoned... hence it is _in flux_.

## Current Features

- Write posts in markdown.
- Index and post pages.
- Simple HTML templating system.
  - Site-wide and post-specific constants.
  - File inclusion.
- Development server.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this source tree or download a release.
2. `pip install <source dir / release file>`.
3. Create a site with `flux create site "<site name>"`, `cd` into the created directory.
4. Read the `help.txt` file.

## Contributing

I'll review any PRs improving what exists here. If you want to add new functionality let's talk before-hand.
