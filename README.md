# About Flux
Flux is a personal blog engine (currently a markdown SSG). It does what I want from it at this moment, and is bound to change with my requirements. Or, you know, be abandoned... hence it is *in flux*.

## Current Features
<!-- 
    We're going to have an index and article template. Generated HTML elements will be placed inside of divs given a hard-coded ID. Metadata values, (string: string) pairs in MD article comment headers, will be inserted into the templates where their key is between open and closing curly braces. When started we'll generate a static directory and serve it with the built-in HTTP server. I'll write the CSS to support mobile and desktop screen sizes.

 - Nothing!
